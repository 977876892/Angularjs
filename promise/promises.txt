 promise :-
 --------------
   A promise is a special type of Object  or asynchronous operation.A promise has three states, pending, resolved or rejected.promises because we are “promised” a         result at a future point in time.a promise will execute when use resolved.

 How does promise work :- 
 ----------------------------------------
 The Promise constructor take a function that will be executed immediately and passes in two functions: resolve and reject. resolve must be called when the
 Promise is resolved (passing a result), and reject when it is rejected (passing an error).

 Deferred :-
 ---------------
 Deferred returns promise object.When Deferred completes, You call methods resolve( ), reject( ) .
 A new instance of defer is created by calling $q.defer(). It has mainly three methods.
  .resolve(value) – This method is use to pass the result.
  .reject(value) – This method is use to pass error.
  .notify(value) – This method is used to notify the current state .
